## Design patterns
- Add screenshots of code
- No constraints on length

## Sprint retrospectives
- Add them on GitLab

## Issues
- Add a description and make sure that they have a definition of 'done'

## Testing
- For integration MockMVC, Postman (document everything), Mocking can be used
- Everybody should do some boundary testing

## Madalina needs work! 
- Adomas could use some for the refactoring of the Activity class
