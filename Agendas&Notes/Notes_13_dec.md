## Coming Weeks
- 2nd assignment is only refactoring, if its not crucial then can do it for 2nd assignment
- most important is to get it working
- For next sprint, have your own microservice working
- deadline is 23rd, finish your microservice and then help others and check connectivity

## Assignment 1 feedback
- Authentication micro-service should be connected to another micro-service
- Should talk about chain of responsibility in matching rather than in authentication

## Issues
- Each feature should have been implemented on its own branch
- Should have had more granularity of issues

## Next meeting
- 16:45, online, Madalina chairman, Adomas notetaker
